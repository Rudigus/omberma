Cool games that involve bombs (you know what I mean):

Bomberman // The classic
Bomb It // Game I used to play in game aggregators with my niece
Bouboum! // Online game from the creators of Transformice. I like their bomb variety.
Playing With Fire // Old classic game, simple but fun. It's really cool, trust me
Bomber Friends // Mobile online bomber game, I'd call it the Clash Royale of the Bomberman genre.
Super Mario War // It's not a bomber game, but for some reason I think it fits here. The different gamemodes and
// the settings customizations are really cool, and it's a really fun game.

I'd be pretty happy if my game could be like Playing with Fire but with local + online multiplayer. Also,
some player and settings customizations would be very welcomed, along with many gamemodes.
