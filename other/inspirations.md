Cool games that involve bombs (you know what I mean):

Bomberman // The classic.

Bomb It // Game I used to play in game aggregators with my niece. It has some features like rideable everything
// (pets, cars, etc) and some cool weapons outside of bombs. Some game modes too. You could buy outfits with money you
// got battling.

Bouboum! // Online game from the creators of Transformice. I like their bomb variety. There are many pros,
// I can't hold a candle :(

Playing With Fire // Old classic game, simple but fun. It's really cool, trust me. There aren't many fancy features,
// but it has just the essential to let you have fun.

Bomber Friends // Mobile online bomber game, I'd call it the Clash Royale of the Bomberman genre. One of its cool features
// is that the bombs have a number on them, which represents the blast power of the bomb, so people can plan their 
// movements better (well, if you manage to keep a fast reaction time even after reading the bombs' associated numbers). 

doesn't involve bombs:

Super Mario War // It's not a bomber game, but for some reason I think it fits here. The different game modes and
// the settings customizations are really cool, and it's a really fun game.

I'd be pretty happy if my game could be like Playing with Fire but with local + online multiplayer. Also,
some player and settings customizations would be very welcomed, along with many game modes.
